# Duct server.http.jetty [![Build Status](https://github.com/duct-framework/server.http.jetty/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/duct-framework/server.http.jetty/actions/workflows/test.yml)

Integrant multimethods for running a [Jetty][] server for the [Duct][]
framework.

[jetty]: https://eclipse.org/jetty/
[duct]: https://github.com/duct-framework/duct

## Installation

Add the following dependency to your deps.edn file:

    org.duct-framework/server.http.jetty {:mvn/version "0.3.3"}

Or to your Leiningen project file:

    [org.duct-framework/server.http.jetty "0.3.3"]

## Usage

The multimethods dispatch off the `:duct.server.http/jetty` key, which
is derived from `:duct.server/http`. The corresponding value is a map
of options for the [Ring Jetty Adapter][], plus a `:handler` key that
takes a handler function.

For example:

```clojure
{:duct.server.http/jetty
 {:port    3000
  :handler #ig/ref :app.example/handler}
 :app.example/handler {}}
```

A `:logger` key may also be specified, which is be used to log when the
server starts and when it stops. The value of the key should be an
implementation of the `duct.logger/Logger` protocol from the
[duct.logger][] library.
